  Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks (DNN) by implanting hidden backdoors that can be activated
  with predefined triggers to manipulate model behaviors maliciously. Existing 3D point cloud backdoor attacks primarily 
  rely on sample-wise global modifications, resulting in suboptimal stealthiness. To address this limitation, we propose 
  Stealthy Patch-Wise Backdoor Attack (SPBA), which employs the first patch-wise trigger for 3D point clouds and restricts
  perturbations to local regions, significantly enhancing stealthiness. Specifically, SPBA decomposes point clouds into local 
  patches and evaluates their geometric complexity using a curvature-based patch imperceptibility score, ensuring that the 
  trigger remains less perceptible to the human eye by strategically applying it across multiple geometrically complex patches 
  with lower visual sensitivity. By leveraging the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT), SPBA optimizes a patch-wise spectral trigger 
  that perturbs the spectral features of selected patches, enhancing attack effectiveness while preserving the global geometric
  structure of the point cloud. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that SPBA consistently 
  achieves an attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 96.5% across different models while achieving state-of-the-art imperceptibility compared to existing backdoor attack methods.
