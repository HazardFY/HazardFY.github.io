  Recent studies have revealed that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers insert a pre-defined backdoor into a DNN model by poisoning a few training samples. A small subset of neurons in DNN is responsible for activating this backdoor and pruning these backdoor-associated neurons has been shown to mitigate the impact of such attacks. Current neuron pruning techniques often face challenges in accurately identifying these critical neurons, and they typically depend on the availability of labeled clean data, which is not always feasible. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense strategy called Contrastive Neuron Pruning (CNP). This approach is based on the observation that poisoned samples tend to cluster together and are distinguishable from benign samples in the feature space of a backdoored model. Given a backdoored model, we initially apply a reversed trigger to benign samples, generating multiple positive (benign-benign) and negative (benign-poisoned) feature pairs from the backdoored model. We then employ contrastive learning on these pairs to improve the separation between benign and poisoned features. Subsequently, we identify and prune neurons in the Batch Normalization layers that show significant response differences to the generated pairs. By removing these backdoor-associated neurons, CNP effectively defends against backdoor attacks while requiring the pruning of only about 1% of the total neurons. Comprehensive experiments conducted on various benchmarks validate the efficacy of CNP, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in mitigating backdoor attacks compared to existing methods.
