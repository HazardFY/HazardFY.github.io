abstract: >-
  We propose a novel Federated Adaptive Reweighting (FedAR) algorithm for medical image classification. FedAR employs a flexible re-weighting scheme that can balance adaptively the contributions of the amount of data and the performance of the local model on each client to the weight of that client.
